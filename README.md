PluMA plugin that runs Infomap (Edler et al., 2017) for community
detection on a network.  This plugin was generated by PluGen, and assumes
that Infomap has been installed locally.

Communities are output as a .tree file, with finer-grained communities
detected at lower levels of the tree.

An input .NET file provides the initial network.

Infomap is available here, under the GNU Public License:

The plugin relies on Infomap to be in the system PATH.
